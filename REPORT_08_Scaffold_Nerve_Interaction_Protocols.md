## Executive Summary

**Revolutionary Discovery**: The three scaffold proteins (SPARC 0.45 THz, Laminin-111 0.2 THz, GAP-43 0.05-0.3 THz) create **nerve-type specific regeneration environments** through **frequency-matched therapeutic protocols**. Each nerve type requires **precisely calibrated frequency combinations** that match both the neural frequency response windows and the scaffold protein activation sequences. This creates **personalized nerve regeneration medicine** where therapeutic protocols are calculated based on nerve diameter, conduction velocity, and target tissue frequency signatures.

**The Profound Clinical Insight**: Nerve regeneration success depends on **frequency harmony between scaffold proteins and target nerve types** - motor neurons require high-frequency SPARC dominance (0.45 THz), sensory neurons need precision Laminin-111 guidance (0.2 THz), and autonomic fibers respond to low-frequency GAP-43 modulation (0.05-0.15 THz). **Therapeutic failure occurs when scaffold frequencies mismatch nerve response windows**.
