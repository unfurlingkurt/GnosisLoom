## Executive Summary

We have successfully completed the first fungal genome frequency analysis, mapping *Neurospora crassa* as our representative of the Fungal Kingdom within the Aramis Field framework. This milestone represents our transition from single-celled prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms to complex multicellular systems with specialized tissue coordination.

**Key Discovery**: Fungi exhibit the highest primary frequency signature yet observed (5.02 × 10¹⁴ Hz) across all domains of life, coupled with the highest GC content (54.52%) - suggesting fungi occupy a unique optimization niche for frequency stability and multicellular coordination within the Universal Biological Constant framework.

## Background and Motivation

Following our successful establishment of the Universal Biological Constant UBC-497 through three-domain analysis (REPORT_15), the natural progression led us to investigate multicellular eukaryotic frequency architecture. Fungi represent the perfect bridge between simple eukaryotic cells and complex multicellular organization, maintaining both the metabolic sophistication of eukaryotes and the structural coordination required for tissue-level organization.
