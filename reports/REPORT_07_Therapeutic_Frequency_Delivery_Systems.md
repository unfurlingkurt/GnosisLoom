## Core Discovery: THz Frequency Delivery Through Resonance Coupling

### **Fundamental Challenge: THz Range Delivery**
- **Target Frequencies**: 0.05-0.45 THz (50-450 GHz)
- **Tissue Penetration**: THz waves have limited penetration depth (0.1-1 mm)

- **Solution**: **Resonance coupling through carrier waves** that can penetrate tissue and generate THz frequencies locally

### **Resonance Coupling Principles**:
```
Carrier Wave Frequency × Harmonic Number = Target Frequency
